1. Launch GNS3:
Open GNS3 application on your system.

2. Create a New Project:
Go to File → New Project.

Name your project (e.g., Three_Node_Network) and click OK.

3. Add Devices:
Virtual PCs (VPCS): These are used to represent the end devices.

From the Devices Toolbar (left panel), drag and drop 3 Virtual PCs (VPCS) onto the workspace.

Switches: You need at least 2 switches to interconnect the PCs.

From the Devices Toolbar, drag and drop 2 switches onto the workspace.

4. Connect the Devices:

Click on the "Add a Link" button (represented by the cable icon in the toolbar).

Click on each device to establish connections:

Connect PC1 to Switch1.

Connect PC2 to Switch1.

Connect PC3 to Switch2.

Connect Switch1 to Switch2.

5. Configure IP Addresses for Each PC:
Right-click on PC1 and select Console to open the command window.

Type the following command to assign an IP address to PC1:
ip 192.168.1.1/24
This assigns 192.168.1.1 with subnet 255.255.255.0 to PC1.

Right-click on PC2 and select Console to open the command window.

Type the following command to assign an IP address to PC2:

ip 192.168.1.2/24

This assigns 192.168.1.2 with subnet 255.255.255.0 to PC2.

Right-click on PC3 and select Console to open the command window.

Type the following command to assign an IP address to PC3:

ip 192.168.1.3/24
This assigns 192.168.1.3 with subnet 255.255.255.0 to PC3.

6. Test Network Connectivity (Ping Test):
Test between PCs on the same subnet:

PC1 → PC2:

Open PC1's console and type:

ping 192.168.1.2
PC1 should be able to ping PC2 successfully.

PC2 → PC1:

Open PC2's console and type:

ping 192.168.1.1
PC2 should be able to ping PC1 successfully.

Test between PCs connected via different switches:

PC1 → PC3:

Open PC1's console and type:

ping 192.168.1.3
PC1 should be able to ping PC3 successfully (because the switches are connected).

PC3 → PC1:

Open PC3's console and type:

ping 192.168.1.1
PC3 should be able to ping PC1 successfully.

7. Save the Project:
Once the network connectivity is verified, save your project.

Go to File → Save Project.

Give it a name and save the configuration.
