Create this file:
Name it: bus_topology.tcl

Paste this code:

# Make a simulator
set ns [new Simulator]

# Make files to store data
set nf [open bus_topology.nam w]
$ns namtrace-all $nf
set tf [open bus_topology.tr w]
$ns trace-all $tf

# Make 2 nodes (like 2 computers)
set n0 [$ns node]
set n1 [$ns node]

# Connect them with a wire (bus)
$ns duplex-link $n0 $n1 1Mb 10ms DropTail

# Limit how many packets can wait
$ns queue-limit $n0 $n1 50

# Set up TCP connection
set tcp [new Agent/TCP]
$ns attach-agent $n0 $tcp
set sink [new Agent/TCPSink]
$ns attach-agent $n1 $sink
$ns connect $tcp $sink

# Send traffic using CBR (constant speed)
set cbr [new Application/Traffic/CBR]
$cbr set packetSize_ 512
$cbr set rate_ 250Kb
$cbr attach-agent $tcp

# Start sending at 0.1 second, stop at 99.9
$ns at 0.1 "$cbr start"
$ns at 99.9 "$cbr stop"

# Finish the simulation
proc finish {} {
    global ns nf tf
    $ns flush-trace
    close $nf
    close $tf
    exec nam bus_topology.nam &
    exec xgraph throughput.xg -geometry 800x400 &
    exit 0
}

$ns at 100.0 "finish"
$ns run
 Run the Simulation
Open your terminal and type:

bash
Copy
Edit
ns bus_topology.tcl
This runs the network and makes files:

bus_topology.nam – for animation

bus_topology.tr – for results

Make AWK Script to Measure Throughput
Create a new file:
Name it: throughput.awk

Paste this code:

BEGIN {
    time_window = 1;
    current_time = 0;
    bytes = 0;
}
{
    event = $1;
    time = $2;
    node_id = $4;

    if (event == "r" && node_id == "1") {
        pkt_size = $6;
        if (time < current_time + time_window) {
            bytes += pkt_size;
        } else {
            throughput = (bytes * 8) / 1000.0;
            printf("%0.2f %0.2f\n", current_time, throughput) >> "throughput.xg";
            current_time += time_window;
            bytes = pkt_size;
        }
    }
}
END {
    if (bytes > 0) {
        throughput = (bytes * 8) / 1000.0;
        printf("%0.2f %0.2f\n", current_time, throughput) >> "throughput.xg";
    }
}
 Run the AWK Script
After the simulation is done, in the terminal type:

awk -f throughput.awk bus_topology.tr

It will make a file called throughput.xg

Plot the Graph
Now draw the graph:
xgraph throughput.xg -geometry 800x400
